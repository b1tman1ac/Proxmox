# Proxmox Home Lab Build

A how to guide to plan and track a Proxmox home lab build. This guide was initially written for Proxmox 6.2 but will be kept up to date as necessary.

# The Goals
These are my goals for this project.

- **Easy to build & maintain,** *in case I need to rebuild it from scratch*
- **Modular,** *I prefer to put things in a Container or VM rather then the base config*
- **Secure,** *Security built in*
- **Single host (no HA),** *this is a home lab build not Enterprise Production, I can afford some downtime and don't need High Availability*
- **Redundant Storage,** *In case of drive failure*
- **Offsite/Offhost Backups,** *In case of complete host failure*
- **Monitoring & Alerts,** *to know whats going on*
- **Automated,** *Automate as much as possible*
